### Developing
SAS PES uses Webpack so you will have to run a few commands to get a development version of the extension. After running the following commands, you will have a directory named `dist`. You can then add this directory in as an extension in your browser of choice.

#### For Firefox
```
npm install
npm run webpack:build:firefox
```

#### For Chromium/Chromium based browsers
```
npm install
npm run webpack:build:chromium
```
